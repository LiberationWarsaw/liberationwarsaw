      <h2>About The Save Movement</h2>
      <div class="about-save">
        <p>The Save Movement is comprised of groups around the world who bear witness of pigs, cows, chickens and other farmed animals en route to slaughter. Our goals are to raise awareness about the plight of farmed animals, to help people become vegan, and to build a mass-based, grassroots animal justice movement. The Save Movement started in December 2010 with the inception of Toronto Pig Save. Today there are over 200 groups in Canada, the U.S., U.K. and Ireland, Australia, continental Europe, Hong Kong, and South America.</p>
        <p>Philly Farmed Animal Save was founded in 2017 by Liberation Philadelphia. If you would like to get involved, please contact Mary Kate at mkfain1@gmail.com</p>

        <h2>Campaigns</h2>
        <div class="about-save">
          <p>Philly Farmed Animal Save has been joining activists nationwide to target <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ejdOIJExdtI">Saba Halal Live Poultry</a>, particularly thier Kensington location. We host monthly vigils there, and have been able to negotiate for the release of four animals so far. We plan to tartet every slaughterhouse in the city, with the goal of shutting them down in the next 5 years.</p>

        <h2>Rescues</h2>
        <div class="about-save">
          <p>After two successful vigils outside Saba Live Poultry, members of Philly Farmed Animal Save entered the slaughterhouse and asked Saba if we could take any sick or injured animals. A slaughterhouse worker agreed to release Liberty and Bella to us, and a few days later, Irene and Holly as well. They received immediate veterinary care for respiratory illness and sinus infections which the developed as a result of the horrible conditions in which they were kept at Saba.</p>
          <p>Once inside their foster home, their personalities shined through as they started recovering in only a few short days. It quickly became apparent that they each had their own likes and dislikes, interests, and attitudes. All four chickens now live at Rancho Relaxo in New Jersey where they will live out the rest of their lives free from harm and exploitation.

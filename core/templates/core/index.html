      <h2>Together, we can achieve animal liberation</h2>
      <p>We want non-humans animals to be legally recognized as persons. We believe it is possible to achieve this in less than 40 years. We've set a goal to <strong>ban meat in Philadelphia by 2033</strong>; it's mostly symbolic, but we do believe it will happen <em>if all of you show up.</em></p>
      <p>We believe in a world were all sentient beings, human and non-human, are free from the bonds of oppression. We have seen throughout history groups of oppressed people overthrow their masters and take back their inalliable rights. For animals, humans must be their ambassadors, and many of us have already begun speaking out. <em>Animal liberation</em> is just a theoretic concept to some, but to us it is an inevitability.</p>
      <p>Liberation Philly is dedicated to being a feminist and anti-racist organization, and follows non-hierarchical organizing priciples. We encourage people from all walks of life to get involved.</p>

      <h2>Based on past social justice movements</h2>
      <p>Unlike other animal rights groups, we operate based on the successes on past social justice movements, and use history and social science to guide our actions and decisions. We use tactics that have a long history of raising societal consiousness, sparking conversation, and pushing a silenced issue to the forefront of debate.</p>
      <p>Non-violent direct action and civil disobedience have been used with overwhelming success across the world. From Ghandi to Martin Luther King Jr, to Emmeline Pankhurst, non-violent direct action has proven to mobilize the masses. This is the mobilization we are now creating for animal liberation.</p>
